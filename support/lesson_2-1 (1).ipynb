    "# Introduction to time series analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of time series analysis. Time series are a very common type of data. Applications of time series analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demand forecasting:** electricity production, internet bandwidth, traffic management, inventory management\n",
    "- **Medicine:** time dependent treatment effects, IoT monitoring devices\n",
    "- **Engineering and science:** signal analysis, analysis of physical processes\n",
    "- **Capital markets and economics:** seasonal unemployment, risk analysis, financial analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic properties of time series\n",
    "- How to perform and understand decomposition of time series\n",
    "- Modeling of time series residuals and the ARIMA model\n",
    "- Forecasting time series values from models\n",
    "\n",
    "What sets **time series data** apart from the kind of data we have been dealing with so far (sometimes referred to as **cross-sectional data**) is that in time series data, we are really only interested in predictions *beyond the range* of available data. This means that we look at the past not so much to model the past, but rather to predict the future, which we also call **forecasting**. We say that forecasting is a type of **extrapolation**, whereas in predicting in general is usually a type of **interpolation**. Of course we may also need to extrapolate with cross-sectional data, but with time series data extrapolation is the rule, not the exception. As we will see, in practice, many of the methods we learned for linear regression can still be employed here, but with some modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important new word we encounter in this notebook in the the word **process**: In the past notebooks, generating random samples from a distribution was called **Monte Carlo simulations**. In the context of time series data where each sample generated may depend on the previous ones, we use the word **process** instead, and we say the data was generated using a **stochastic process** where the word stochastic means that it's probability-based and hence noisy (the opposite of the word **deterministic**). So we say that we are generating a sequence of random numbers based on a stochastic process, i.e. a probability rule that links each instance to the previous ones."

Since the series is IID there is no correlation from one value to the next. Usually $t$ is descrete and evenly-spaced, such as $t = 1, 2, \\dots$, but $t$ can also be discrete but unevenly spaced, or even continuous. In practice, when the time variable is continuous, we end up sampling it at discrete and usually evenly-spaced time points so it becomes discrete.\n",

    "The values of the white noise series are IID, so we do not expect the values to show any dependency over time. In time series analysis we measure dependency using **auto-correlation**. Auto-correlation is the correlation of a series with itself **lagged** (offset in time) by some number of time steps. Auto-correlation at lag $k$, denoted by $\\rho_k$ is the correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t-k}$ for all times $t$. Notice that for any series, $\\rho_0 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define a second order **partial auto-correlation**. The partial autocorrelation at lag $k$ is the correlation that remains after we remove the effect of any correlations due to the terms $X_{t-i}$ for $i<k$. We can think of this as being the **direct effect** at lag $k$ after removing all indirect effects at lags $i = 1, \\dots, k-1$. There are more computationally efficient ways to calculate partial auto-correlation, but the most intuitive way to do so is the following: If $X_t = \\phi_1X_{t-1} + \\phi_2X_{t-2}$ then $\\phi_2$ is the partial auto-correlation at lag 2."

    "The **autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)** model adds an integrating term to the ARMA model. The integrating component performs differencing to model a random walk component. The integrating component models one of the **non-stationary** parts of a time series. The ARIMA model is defined by orders $(p, d, q)$. We have already looked at $\\text{AR}(p)$ and $\\text{MA}(q)$ models. The order of the differencing operator of the integrating term is defined by $d$. Since the integrating term is a differencing operator, there is no coefficient to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further extend the ARIMA model by letting it model seasonality-related components. The result is called a Seasonal ARIMA or **SARIMA** model, written as $\\text{SARIMA}(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)_m$. The parameters $(p, d, q)$ are from ARIMA, and the parameters $(P, D, Q)$ their equivalent counterparts, but apply to the seasonal component. Finally, $m$ is the length of the peroid that makes the data seasonal.\n",

    "In the following section, we first generate an ARMA **process**. This means we fix $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ in the equation below, then randomly generate the first element of the sequence, feed it through the equation and end up with a sequence of random numbers.\n",

We can then see how close the model's estimates of the coefficients (let's call them $\\hat \\alpha_i$ and $\\hat \\beta_i$) come to the actual coefficents used in the process $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$."

    "In this notebook we explored basic properties of time series. We learned how ARMA models can be used with **stationary** data, and how we can decompose the data into a trend, a seasonal and a residual component and fit an ARMA model to its **residual component**. Alternatively, we learned how ARMA models can be extened to ARIMA by adding the **difference** operator, and SARIMA by adding a seasonal component. ARIMA can be used for non-stationary data with a trend, and SARIMA can be used with non-stationary data with a trend and seasonality. There are further extensions of these models that make it possible to model time series data when the variance changes over time, namely the **autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity** or **ARCH** and **generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity** or **GARCH** model, but these models are beyond the scope of this notebook."

Of course we can rely on a metric like RMSE, but we don't want that to be the sole determinant. The level of familiarity with this or that algorithm should also be important. For example, we spent a lot of time learning about linear models, so even if the linear model is a slight worse fit we may prefer it because they are efficient and we can focus on feature engineering to improve its performance. ARIMA models on the other hand have the advantage of taking care of a lot of the feature engineering, but they are more difficult to explainr and require more experience in order to tune well.
